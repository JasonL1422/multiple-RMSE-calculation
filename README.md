# multiple-RMSE-calculation
* The script calculates RMSE (root-mean-squared error) between multiple data from simulation and an experimental data.
* This is to compare the multiple stress-strain curve from simulation/calculation with an experimental data to find the best fit curve.
* One dataset (one test result) and experimental data are a pair of two stress-strain curves. It calculates RMSE for each as well as the average.
* In the python script, the number of test, excel file name, sheet name should be updated according to your data and file. 
* The test data from simulation/calculation should be organized as in the form in excel file. Details will be updated.
